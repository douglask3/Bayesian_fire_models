####Select an area from an .nc file with CDO in the terminal####

#make sure your area (mask_region) is in .nc and in the same grid size as your input (input_global) .nc file.
#Convert from .shp to .nc, if that is the case.

##regrid to the same grid as your input_global.nc file in the terminal

cdo remapnn,input_global.nc mask_region.nc mask_region_regrid.nc

#compare mask_region.nc and mask_region_regrid.nc (on QGIS, for example) to check if not much was lost during regrid.
#If it was, try are other functions to regrid. For example, remapbil

##Crop the input file to the region
